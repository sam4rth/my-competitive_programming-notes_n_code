My competitive programming journey 
I am not very much into it, but it's kind of fun at the same time, kind of triggers the JEE PTSD, and I don't belong there, TRUST ME.

The repo contains my solutions to the problems, and I try my best to name them correctly. Not all solutions are complete.
There is not much you can take away from this repo except for the fact that this contains my notes about problems and can help you identify patterns and get resrouces

THE NOTES ARE IN THE "CP NOTES" folder, though written in markdown, they are pretty only in Logseq
